I try to write my PhD-Thesis using Latex and found a template 
here: https://www.matthiaspospiech.de/latex/templates/thesis/

So I do some changes, e.g. already added a Makefile, so it fits my needs. 
If you happen to find your self wasting your time writing a PhD-Thesis, 
feel free to use it and drink a beer more and remember me.
